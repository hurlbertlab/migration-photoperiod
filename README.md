# How the effects of latitude on daylight availability may have influenced the evolution of migration and photoperiodism

Keith W. Sockman and Allen H. Hurlbert. Journal of Functional Ecology.

A shiny app for visualizing how photoperiod and total daylight exposure varies with the timing and location of migration


# ShinyApp
Access the shinyapp through your browser here: https://hurlbertlab.shinyapps.io/migration-photoperiod/

# Local installation
1. If you have R and RStudio installed locally, you can run the app on your own machine.
2. Load the shiny app library by typing `library(shiny)`. If you have never used this package before, you will first need to load it: `install.packages("shiny")`.
3. Clone the repository to your machine.
4. Open the folder for the repository (titled "migration-photoperiod") wherever it was saved on your machine.
5. Double click the _migration-photoperiod.Rproj_ file, which will open RStudio.
6. Open the file app.R.
7. Click the _Run App_ button.
8. The interactive visualization will open in a separate RStudio window.
