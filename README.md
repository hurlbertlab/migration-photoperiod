# How the effects of latitude on daylight availability may have influenced the evolution of migration and photoperiodism

Keith W. Sockman and Allen H. Hurlbert. Journal of Functional Ecology.

A shiny app for visualizing how photoperiod and total daylight exposure varies with the timing and location of migration


# ShinyApp
Access the shinyapp through your browser here: https://hurlbertlab.shinyapps.io/migration-photoperiod/

# Local installation
1. If you have both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed locally, you can run the app on your own machine.
2. Clone the repository to your machine (if you do not use Git or Github, the easiest way to do this is click the green `Clone or Download` button and select _Download ZIP_)
3. Open the folder for the repository (titled "migration-photoperiod") wherever it was saved on your machine.
4. Double click the _app.R_ file, which will open in RStudio.
5. Click the _Run App_ button.
6. If prompted, install the `shiny` package.
7. The interactive visualization will open in a separate RStudio window.
