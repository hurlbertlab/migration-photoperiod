# How the effects of latitude on daylight availability may have influenced the evolution of migration and photoperiodism

Keith W. Sockman and Allen H. Hurlbert. Journal of Functional Ecology.

A shiny app for visualizing how photoperiod and total daylight exposure varies with the timing and location of migration


# ShinyApp
Access the shinyapp through your browser here: https://hurlbertlab.shinyapps.io/migration-photoperiod/

# Local installation
1. If you have R/RStudio installed locally, you can run the app on your own machine.
2. Clone the repository to your machine.
3. Open the folder for the repository (titled "migration-photoperiod") wherever it was saved on your machine.
4. Double click the _migration-photoperiod.Rproj_ file, which will open RStudio.
5. Open the file app.R.
6. Click the _Run App_ button.
7. The interactive visualization will open in a separate RStudio window.
